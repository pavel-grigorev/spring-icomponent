/**
 * Beans of this type are to resolve a method handler, i.e. bean of type {@link MethodHandler},
 * for the given method represented by {@link MethodMetadata}.
 *
 * Multiple method handler resolvers may be defined in the application, each being responsible
 * for a specific type of method handler.
 *
 * When proxies are being created fo the interfaces the framework performs method handler lookup
 * for every interface method. It does so by running all method handler resolvers one by one
 * until it obtains a method handler. The first method handler obtained is going to be linked
 * with the method. To control the order in which the resolvers run use {@link Order}.
 *
 * If all method handler resolvers return {@code null} for the given method then
 * {@link BeanInstantiationException} is thrown.
 *
 * There are two pre-built method handler resolvers:
 *
 * {@link HandlerAnnotationMethodHandlerResolver} is responsible for {@link Handler} annotation.
 *
 * {@link DefaultMethodHandlerResolver} is responsible for {@link DefaultMethodHandler} annotation.
 *
